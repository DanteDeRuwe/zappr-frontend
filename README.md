## Progress update

### General thoughts
GraphQL is very nice to work with, if it itself wants to work with you. The combination of just learning Angular together with immediately adding GraphQL into the mix proves to be quite hard. 

### What have I done?
The project at this stage consists of a series-module, in which I have a "dumb component" `series-showcase` to deal with presentation logic and a "smart" component `discover` that pulls data from the `seriesdata` service.

### Improvements in the short term
I'm working on providing a model / doing static typing, as now I mainly try stuff out with `any`.
It proves to be quite difficult to do static typing with GraphQL, so as of this current deadline it isn't finished yet.

### Long term goals

- Discover
- Watchlist
- Commenting on series
- Favoriting series
- Rating series
- Watch episode, actor, season data
- ...


## Conclusion
Learning Angular while learning to work with GraphQL Apollo and GraphQL-dotnet proves to be hard. I have also not chosen the easiest of projects, but I am determined to make this count!
